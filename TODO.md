# TODO

## Doing
- Simple API for uploading contents to a server that can later be retreived

## Backend
- User Creation
- Authentication service
- Database setup
    - Video file storage
    - User information storage
    - Collaborators
- External service authentication (youtube)

## UI
- Login forms
- Embedded video player
    - Can something like this even be done with HTMX?
    - HTML5 has a <video> element
        - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp
- Some type of feedback / messaging board between creators and editors?


## Chores
- Sort out standard for structuring projects
- Check out templ for the front end?
- Is HTMX always server side rendering? What's relied on the client when using HTMX
